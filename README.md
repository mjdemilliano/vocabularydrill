# Vocabularydrill

This tool helps you learn new languages by presenting you with random words from
a vocabulary and allowing you to see the answer after pushing a button. You
indicate whether you had it right or wrong, and the tool uses this information
to show you the troublesome words more often.

Current developments focus on adding a server backend to be able to share results
across devices (currently results are stored in Local Storage), and to allow for
correcting mistakes from the interface itself.
